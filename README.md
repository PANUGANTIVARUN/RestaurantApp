Instructions:
The API returns the dish categories and the dishes in that category.
The dish categories should be slidable.
If a dish has addons(addoncat), then it should display the text “Customizations available”.
Clicking on the + and - buttons should update the count accordingly and also on the cart icon on the top bar.
Implement maintainable and reusable coding standards.
